# ThT Analysis GUI

### Author: Jack P Connor

## General Overview
This code uses TKinter to create a GUI built for analysing ThT assays using data directly from a plate reader as the input.
First, select which data you would like to analyse and it will bring you to the analysis screen. 
From here you can select the wells you wish to analyse by clicking on them. 
You are then able to specify how you want the results to be plotted including normalisation and curve fit equations.
From the GUI you can directly save plots, save the raw data in a tidy format and save the calculated fit parameters.
